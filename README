A bunch of dumb packages for doing dumb things.

bufint: wrapper for big.Int to be used for accumulators, with intermediary values buffered and flushed only when necessary.
usage: 
x := bufint.BigAccumulator{Val:new(big.Int)}
x.AddInt(12345)
fmt.Println(x.Value())

bufint.Value() returns the underlying big.Int, which can be passed to functions requiring explicit big.Int
bufint.AddInt(y int) will add the value y to an internal accumulator, which is flushed when .Value() is requested or when an overflow would occur.

This allows big.Int accumulators without the overhead of having to cast from int->int64->big.Int each time a small value is added.

See bufbig_example.go

NOTE: Only implements AddInt method, as it's purpose is for incremental accumulators.
